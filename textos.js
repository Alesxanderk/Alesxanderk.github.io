		`Living in a large city offers many opportunities, but it also presents challenges.
		On the one hand, people can find better jobs and services.
		However, daily life can be stressful because of noise and traffic.
		For this reason, some people prefer quieter places.
		In my opinion, the best option depends on personal priorities.`,

		Nevertheless, online interaction cannot fully replace real meetings.
		Spending time together in person strengthens relationships.

		`Education plays a crucial role in personal and social development.
